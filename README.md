Open `index.html` and customize:

- **Line 7:** Change the page title
- **Line 21-24:** Update the anniversary dates and message

- **Line 155-200:** Update the "365 Reasons Why" cards with your own reasons

### 3. Adjust Colors (Optional)

Open `style.css` and modify the color variables at the top (lines 10-17) to match your preferred color scheme.
